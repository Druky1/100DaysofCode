📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡 :

➡ We use the two pointer approach to where the 𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐫 loop denotes the 𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐬 iteration and the 𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐫 loop represents the 𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐦𝐧𝐬 iteration.

➡ Having each iteration, it interchanges the values of 𝐢 with 𝐣 to obtain the transpose of the matrix.

➡ For the last loop, it uses the 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 function to 𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞 the matrix by 90 degrees to achieve the rotated image of the matrix.
