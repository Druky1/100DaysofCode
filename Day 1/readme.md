----------------------------------------------------
Problem Link: https://lnkd.in/eA72UsKb

📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:

Starting off with the use of 𝐁𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡, the logic was to check if the 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭 is less than 𝐞𝐧𝐝, then if the 𝐦𝐢𝐝𝐝𝐥𝐞 𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 is less than the 𝐧𝐞𝐱𝐭 𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭, then store the 𝐦𝐢𝐝 + 1 element in 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭. Finally, when the 𝐦𝐢𝐝𝐝𝐥𝐞 𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 becomes 𝒈𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒓 than the 𝐧𝐞𝐱𝐭 𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭, we have successfully obtained the value of the peak index of the array.
