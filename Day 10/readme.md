----------------------------------------------------------
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/


📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡 :

➡ First, we will iterate through the array 𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐬 and check if the present element and the next element are 𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥 or not, as the array is sorted.

➡ If the condition is true, then we skip the next element and 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐮𝐞 as long as we encounter duplicates of the number.

➡ If the elements are not duplicates, we place the non-duplicate element next to the present element.
