-----------------------------------------------------

📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡 :

➡ Starting off with three conditions to check if the 𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 is a 𝐩𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 of 4 or not.

➡ Check if the 𝐢𝐧𝐩𝐮𝐭 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 is a negative number or zero, if yes then return false. As, something to the power of 4 wouldn't be zero or less than it.

➡ If 𝐢𝐧𝐩𝐮𝐭 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 is 1, then return true as any number raised to 0 occurs, then it would result in 1. Thus, it would be possible.

➡ Also, if the number is not a multiple of 4, then return false.

➡ Finally, return the number which is 𝐝𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 by 4 to get the number which can be represented as power of 4.
