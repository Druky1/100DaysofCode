📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡 :

✅ Taking the first iteration starting from the first index till 𝐧 and storing it in 𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐩, assuming the 𝐳𝐞𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐡 𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐱 is sorted & rest needs to be sorted.

✅ The second loop used for comparison between the two elements, we initialize it [𝐢 - 1], so it is pointing at the 𝐳𝐞𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐡 index.

✅ If the value of [𝐣]𝐭𝐡 index is greater than the 𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐩 variable, then make the [𝐣 + 1] value the same as the [𝐣] index value.

✅ Otherwise, no need to store and break.

✅ Finally, update the [𝐣 + 1] 𝐭𝐡 index value with the 𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐩 value storing 𝐚𝐫𝐫[𝐢] to get the sorted array.
