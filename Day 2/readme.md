Problem Link: https://lnkd.in/eZEbYBaQ

📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:

➡ The logic implemented here was straightforward, the two pointer approach was taken from both sides of the array respectively.
➡ The 𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭_𝐬𝐮𝐦 and 𝐥𝐞𝐟𝐭_𝐬𝐮𝐦 are calculated from both ends simultaneously and matched for equality.
➡ If matched, then return the middle index of the array.
