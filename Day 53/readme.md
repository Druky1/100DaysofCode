📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:

✅ Firstly, started with the main vector of summing the two arrays, using the two pointer approach at the end of both the array to get the 𝐬𝐮𝐦 of the arrays including the carry.

✅ Then, considering three cases where we stored the values of the individual elements while summing into a new vector <𝐚𝐧𝐬>.

✅ Lastly, we created another vector which reverses the resultant array and print the output in the reversed form as the vector storing the 𝐚𝐧𝐬 initially stored the elements from the right, which will now result in proper manner.
