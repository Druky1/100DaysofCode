📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡 (𝐁𝐢𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧):

➡ Firstly, we started off with an edge condition, if 𝐧 is equal to 0, then return the complement as 1.

➡ Next, we create a 𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤 variable, where we try to make it into consecutive 1's by 𝐥𝐞𝐟𝐭 𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐟𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 by 1 and implementing '𝐎𝐑'.

➡ Along with this, to get the number of 1's present, we right shift the input value till it becomes 0.

➡ Finally, taking the complement of input with '𝐀𝐍𝐃' of mask provides us the result.
