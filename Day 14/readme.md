📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡 (𝐁𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡):
➡ Firstly, we find the middle element iterating from the 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭 of the array to the 𝐞𝐧𝐝 of the array.
➡ Then, if the take square of the 𝐦𝐢𝐝, where it the equal to the input integer, then it is present in 𝐦𝐢𝐝.
➡ Otherwise, if square is less than the input integer, then store the value in 𝐚𝐧𝐬, and move 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭 to the right.
➡ Else, we move the 𝐞𝐧𝐝 to the left side of the array and update the 𝐦𝐢𝐝 value.
➡ Finally, once we achieve that square is equal to and rounded down to the nearest integer, return the 𝐚𝐧𝐬.
