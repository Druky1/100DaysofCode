📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:

✅ Used the 𝐭𝐰𝐨 𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 approach on both the given 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 and 𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐬𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 '𝐬' and '𝐭' respectively.

✅ Iterated through both and checked if the 𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭 character matches. If not, then move the indices one by one.

✅ Finally, once the 𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐬𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 has become a part of the actual string leaving the original positions of unmatched characters undisturbed, return the subsequence as 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐞, otherwise 𝐟𝐚𝐥𝐬𝐞.
