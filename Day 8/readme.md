📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:

➡ Initialize a variable 𝐚𝐧𝐬 for storing the result.
➡ Using a while loop until the input integer 𝐧 becomes zero for storing the digits individually.
➡ Now, we store the value of the integer in reverse order by multiplying the 𝐚𝐧𝐬 with 10 and adding the isolated 𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭 to it, which as presented in the code is for storing the digits one by one in reverse order while also updating the value of 𝐧.
➡ Also, checking for the upper and lower limits of 𝐚𝐧𝐬 to be in bound. If it goes out of bound, then return the output as zero. If not, then proceed.
➡ Lastly, return the value of 𝐚𝐧𝐬 as reverse order of the input integer.
