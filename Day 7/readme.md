📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:

➡ In this problem, first we take into account two variables for storing the indices which need to be returned as output.
➡ Then, we iterate through the array as a whole by taking the two pointer approach, taking the element present in the 𝐢𝐭𝐡 index and the (𝐢 + 1)𝐭𝐡 index.
➡ Lastly, we check for the condition if both of the indices 𝐬𝐮𝐦 result to the target variable asked for. If yes, then return the indices successfully.
