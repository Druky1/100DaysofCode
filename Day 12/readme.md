📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡 (𝑩𝒊𝒏𝒂𝒓𝒚 𝑺𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒄𝒉):
➡ Starting off with the general approach of Binary Search, until 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭 is less than equal to 𝐞𝐧𝐝, initialize the middle of the array and if target is found at 𝐦𝐢𝐝, then return the same.
➡ If the 𝐦𝐢𝐝 value is less than the 𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭, then store the value in 𝐚𝐧𝐬 and move to the right half of the array.
➡Otherwise, move to the left half of the array and store the value of mid value in 𝐚𝐧𝐬.
➡Finally, return the 𝐚𝐧𝐬.
