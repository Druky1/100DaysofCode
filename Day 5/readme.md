--------------------------------------------------
Problem Link: https://lnkd.in/ea-XBC7G

📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:

➡ Given array 𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐬 and int 𝐯𝐚𝐥, the intuition was to have two variables for storing and counting the occurrences, temp and count respectively.
➡ Iterating through the array and checking for condition if the array element matches or not with the desired value.
➡ If not matching, then store and count the other values present, removing the undesired value and printing the array back through count.
