📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:

➡ We initialized the respective variables 𝐬𝐮𝐦 = 0 and 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝 = 1, and ran a loop to divide the number into 𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐬.

➡ After that, we stored their respective 𝐬𝐮𝐦 and 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝 by adding and multiplying the digit individually.

➡ Lastly, we stored the difference between the 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝 and the 𝐬𝐮𝐦 to get the result.
