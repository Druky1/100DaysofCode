📌 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡:
➡ Starting off, we proceed with the digits one by one, first the LSB then go till MSB.
➡ If the current digit is smaller than 9 then add one to the current digit and return the array else assign zero to the current digit.
➡ If the last element is processed and it was also equal to 9, it means that all the digits were 9. So, we will increase the size of the array by one and assign 1 to the MSB.
➡ Finally, return the array.
